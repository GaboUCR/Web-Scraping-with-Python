I have an excel sheet that was scraped from the directory below

https://www.lso.ca/public-resources/finding-a-lawyer-or-paralegal/lawyer-and-paralegal-directory

The sheet has the following fields in their own columns:
First name
Last name
Email
Area of Law
Organization/Firm Name
Address
Phone #

I need all missing fields to be found and input into the excel sheet so all missing information is completed. There are 39324 results in the directory with the majority missing some information.
